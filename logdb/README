This directory contains a set of scripts that populate a database
containing information about replays.

$ python fill_db.py <omniplay path>

To make queries, install the sqlite3 CLI.

$ sudo apt-get install sqlite3

Start up the CLI:
$ sqlite3 /replay_logdb/replay.db


Example queries:

Describe the table replays:
sqlite> .schema replays

List all replay instances of Firefox, ordered by date
sqlite> SELECT datetime(date, 'unixepoch'), * FROM replays WHERE program LIKE '%firefox' ORDER BY date;


Running Queries:
To run a query, the db first needs to be populated (see above).

Next, use the run_query.py script to run a query:
Ex: python run_query.py -v [file]

This query runs a backwards query that shows the processes that produced [file].
The -v flag is optional and produces verbose output.

It produces a dot graph of the output in /tmp/output.dot
